MySQL query to rank order a table of votes.  

MySQL function to capitalize the first letter of a word in a string.  

MySQL procedure to split a column into rows using a delimeter.  

I have a table for bugs from a bug tracking software; let’s call the table “bugs”.
The table has four columns (id, open_date, close_date, severity). On any given day
a bug is open if the open_date is on or before that day and close_date is after
that day. For example, a bug is open on “2012-01-01”, if it’s created on or
before “2012-01-01” and closed on or after “2012-01-02”. I want an SQL to show
the number of bugs open each day for a range of dates. Hint: There are bugs that were
never closed.  




Write a query to rank order the following table in MySQL by votes, display the rank as one of the columns.
CREATE TABLE votes ( name CHAR(10), votes INT );
INSERT INTO votes VALUES
('Smith',10), ('Jones',15), ('White',20), ('Black',40), ('Green',50), ('Brown',20); 



Write a procedure in MySQL to split a column into rows using a delimiter.
CREATE TABLE sometbl ( ID INT, NAME VARCHAR(50) );
INSERT INTO sometbl VALUES (1, 'Smith'), (2, 'Julio|Jones|Falcons'), (3, 'White|Snow'), (4, 'Paint|It|Red'), (5, 'Green|Lantern'), (6, 'Brown|bag');
For (2), example rows would look like >> “3, white”, “3, Snow” …
